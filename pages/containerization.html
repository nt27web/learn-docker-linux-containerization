        <h3>What is containerization?</h3>

        <p>Containerization has become a major trend in software development as an alternative or companion to
            virtualization. It involves encapsulating or packaging up software code and all its dependencies so that it
            can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. The technology is quickly maturing, resulting in
            measurable benefits for developers and operations teams as well as overall software infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>Containerization allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely. With
            traditional methods, code is developed in a specific computing environment which, when transferred to a new
            location, often results in bugs and errors. For example, when a developer transfers code from a desktop
            computer to a virtual machine (VM) or from a Linux to a Windows operating system. Containerization
            eliminates this problem by bundling the application code together with the related configuration files,
            libraries, and dependencies required for it to run. This single package of software or “container” is
            abstracted away from the host operating system, and hence, it stands alone and becomes portable—able to run
            across any platform or cloud, free of issues.
        </p>
        <p>The concept of containerization and process isolation is decades old, but the emergence of the open source
            Docker Engine in 2013, an industry standard for containers with simple developer tools and a universal
            packaging approach, accelerated the adoption of this technology.
        </p>
        <p>Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the machine’s operating system kernel
            and do not require the overhead of associating an operating system within each application. Containers are
            inherently smaller in capacity than a VM and require less start-up time, allowing far more containers to run
            on the same compute capacity as a single VM. This drives higher server efficiencies and, in turn, reduces
            server and licensing costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Put simply, containerization allows applications to be “written once and run anywhere.” This portability is
            important in terms of the development process and vendor compatibility. It also offers other notable
            benefits, like fault isolation, ease of management and security, to name a few.

        <h3><a></a>How Does Containerization Actually Work?</h3>
        <p >Each container is an executable package of software, running on top of a host OS. A host
            may support many containers  concurrently, such as in the case of a
            complex microservices architecture that uses numerous containerized ADCs. This setup
            works because all containers run minimal, resource-isolated processes that others cannot access.</p>
        <p >Think of a containerized application as the top layer of a multi-tier cake:</p>
        <ol>
            <li >At the bottom, there is the hardware of the infrastructure in question, including its
                CPU(s), disk storage and network interfaces.
            </li>
            <li >Above that, there is the host OS and its kernel – the latter serves as a bridge
                between the software of the OS and the hardware of the underlying system.
            </li>
            <li >The container engine and its minimal guest OS, which are particular to the
                containerization technology being used, sit atop the host OS.
            </li>
            <li >At the very top are the binaries and libraries (bins/libs) for each application and
                the apps themselves, running in their isolated user spaces (containers).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Application containerization</h3>

        <p>Containers encapsulate an application as a single executable package of software that bundles application
            code together with all of the related configuration files, libraries, and dependencies required for it to
            run. Containerized applications are “isolated” in that they do not bundle in a copy of the operating system.
            Instead, an open source runtime engine (such as the Docker runtime engine) is installed on the host’s
            operating system and becomes the conduit for containers to share an operating system with other containers
            on the same computing system.</p>

        <p>Other container layers, like common bins and libraries, can also be shared among multiple containers. This
            eliminates the overhead of running an operating system within each application and makes containers smaller
            in capacity and faster to start up, driving higher server efficiencies. The isolation of applications as
            containers also reduces the chance that malicious code present in one container will impact other containers
            or invade the host system.</p>

        <p>The abstraction from the host operating system makes containerized applications portable and able to run
            uniformly and consistently across any platform or cloud. Containers can be easily transported from a desktop
            computer to a virtual machine (VM) or from a Linux to a Windows operating system, and they will run
            consistently on virtualized infrastructures or on traditional “bare metal” servers, either on-premise or in
            the cloud. This ensures that software developers can continue using the tools and processes they are most
            comfortable with.</p>

        <p>One can see why enterprises are rapidly adopting containerization as a superior approach to application
            development and management. Containerization allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and
            more securely, whether the application is a traditional monolith (a single-tiered software application) or a
            modular microservice (a collection of loosely coupled services). New cloud-based applications can be built
            from the ground up as containerized microservices, breaking a complex application into a series of smaller
            specialized and manageable services. Existing applications can be repackaged into containers (or
            containerized microservices) that use compute resources more efficiently.
        </p>
        <h3 >Benefits</h3>

        <p>Containerization offers significant benefits to developers and development teams. Among these are the
            following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Portability: </strong>A container creates an executable package of software that is abstracted
                away from  the host operating system, and hence, is portable and able to
                run uniformly and consistently across any platform or cloud.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Agility: </strong>The open source Docker Engine for running containers started the industry
                standard for containers with simple developer tools and a universal packaging approach that works on
                both Linux and Windows operating systems. The container ecosystem has shifted to engines managed by the
                Open Container Initiative (OCI). Software developers can continue using agile or DevOps tools and
                processes for rapid application development and enhancement.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Speed: </strong>Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the
                machine’s operating system (OS) kernel and are not bogged down with this extra overhead. Not only does
                this drive higher server efficiencies, it also reduces server and licensing costs while speeding up
                start-times as there is no operating system to boot.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fault isolation: </strong>Each containerized application is isolated and operates independently
                of others. The failure of one container does not affect the continued operation of any other containers.
                Development teams can identify and correct any technical issues within one container without any
                downtime in other containers. Also, the container engine can leverage any OS security isolation
                techniques—such as SELinux access control—to isolate faults within containers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency: </strong>Software running in containerized environments shares the machine’s OS
                kernel, and application layers within a container can be shared across containers. Thus, containers are
                inherently smaller in capacity than a VM and require less start-up time, allowing far more containers to
                run on the same compute capacity as a single VM. This drives higher server efficiencies, reducing server
                and licensing costs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ease of management: </strong>A container
                orchestration platform automates the installation, scaling, and management of containerized
                workloads and services. Container orchestration platforms can ease management tasks such as scaling
                containerized apps, rolling out new versions of apps, and providing monitoring, logging and debugging,
                among other functions.Kubernetes, perhaps the most popular container
                orchestration system available, is an open source technology (originally open-sourced by Google, based
                on their internal project called Borg) that automates Linux container functions originally. Kubernetes
                works with many container engines, such as Docker, but it also works with any container system that
                conforms to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards for container image formats and runtimes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Security: </strong>The isolation of applications as containers inherently prevents the invasion
                of malicious code from affecting other containers or the host system. Additionally, security permissions
                can be defined to automatically block unwanted components from entering containers or limit
                communications with unnecessary resources.
            </li>
        </ul>
