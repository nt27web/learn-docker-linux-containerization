        <h3>What is virtualization?</h3>

        <p>Virtualization is technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources
            from a single, physical hardware system. Software called a hypervisor connects directly to that hardware and
            allows you to split 1 system into separate, distinct, and secure environments known as virtual machines
            (VMs). These VMs rely on the hypervisor’s ability to separate the machine’s resources from the hardware and
            distribute them appropriately. Virtualization helps you get the most value from previous investments.
        </p>

        <p>The physical hardware, equipped with a hypervisor, is called the host, while the many VMs that use its
            resources are guests. These guests treat computing resources—like CPU, memory, and storage—as a pool of
            resources that can easily be relocated. Operators can control virtual instances of CPU, memory, storage, and
            other resources, so guests receive the resources they need when they need them.

        </p>

      <br>
        <p>There are many reasons why people utilize virtualization in computing. To desktop users, the most common use
            is to be able to run applications meant for a different operating system without having to switch computers
            or reboot into a different system. For administrators of servers, virtualization also offers the ability to
            run different operating systems, but perhaps, more importantly, it offers a way to segment a large system
            into many smaller parts, allowing the server to be used more efficiently by a number of different users or
            applications with different needs. It also allows for isolation, keeping programs running inside of a
            virtual machine safe from the processes taking place in another virtual machine on the same host.

        <h3>What is a hypervisor?</h3>
        <p>A hypervisor is a program for creating and running virtual machines.<br> Hypervisors have traditionally been
            split into two classes: type one, or "bare metal" hypervisors that run guest virtual machines directly on a
            system's hardware, essentially behaving as an operating system. Type two, or "hosted" hypervisors behave
            more like traditional applications that can be started and stopped like a normal program. In modern systems,
            this split is less prevalent, particularly with systems like KVM. KVM, short for kernel-based virtual
            machine, is a part of the Linux kernel that can run virtual machines directly, although you can still use a
            system running KVM virtual machines as a normal computer itself.
        </p>

        <h3>What is a virtual machine?</h3>
        <p>A virtual machine is the emulated equivalent of a computer system that runs on top of another system.<br>
            Virtual
            machines may have access to any number of resources:
            <ui>
                <li>Computing power, through hardware-assisted but limited access to the host machine's CPU and
                    memory.
                </li>
                <li>One or more physical or virtual disk devices for storage.</li>
                <li>A virtual or real network interface.</li>
                <li>As well as any devices such as video cards, USB devices, or other hardware that are shared with the
                    virtual machine.
                </li>
            </ui>
            If the virtual machine is stored on a virtual disk, this is often referred to as a disk image. A disk image
            may contain the files for a virtual machine to boot, or,
            it can contain any other specific storage needs.
        </p>
        <h3>How virtualization works?</h3>
        <p>Virtualization describes a technology in which an application, guest operating system (guest OS) or data
            storage is abstracted away from the true underlying hardware or software. A key use of virtualization
            technology is server virtualization, which uses a software layer -- called a hypervisor -- to emulate the
            underlying hardware. This often includes the CPU's memory, input/output (I/O) and network traffic.
            Hypervisors take the physical resources and separate them so they can be utilized by the virtual
            environment. They are able to sit on top of an OS or they can be directly installed onto the hardware. The
            latter is how most enterprises virtualize their systems.</p>
        <p>The Xen hypervisor is an open source software program that is responsible for managing the low-level
            interactions that occur between virtual machines (VMs) and the physical hardware. In other words, the Xen
            hypervisor allows for the simultaneous creation, execution and management of various virtual machines in one
            physical environment.</p>
        <p>With the help of the hypervisor, the guest OS, normally interacting with true hardware, is now doing so with
            a software emulation of that hardware. Often, the guest OS has no idea it's on virtualized hardware. While
            the performance of this virtual system is not equal to the performance of the operating system running on
            true hardware, the concept of virtualization works because most guest operating systems and applications
            don't need the full use of the underlying hardware. This allows for greater flexibility, control and
            isolation by removing the dependency on a given hardware platform. While initially meant for server
            virtualization, the concept of virtualization has spread to applications, networks, data and desktops.</p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="../images/virtualization3.jpg" alt="inventionimage" style="horiz-align:center;width: 50%">
        </div>
        <p>The virtualization process follows the steps listed below:</p>
        <ui>
            <li>Hypervisors detach the physical resources from their physical environments.</li>
            <li>Resources are taken and divided, as needed, from the physical environment to the various virtual
                environments.
            </li>
            <li>System users work with and perform computations within the virtual environment.</li>
            <li>Once the virtual environment is running, a user or program can send an instruction that requires extra
                resources form the physical environment. In response, the hypervisor relays the message to the physical
                system and stores the changes. This process will happen at an almost native speed.
            </li>
        </ui>
        <br>
        <p>The virtual environment is often referred to as a guest machine or virtual machine. The VM acts like a single
            data file that can be transferred from one computer to another and opened in both. It is expected to perform
            the same way on every computer.
