        <h3>What Is Virtualization?</h3>
        <p>Virtualization provides for the existence of multiple, smaller virtual servers, within the framework of a
            larger server&#8217;s physical environment. The virtualization software which runs on the parent basically
            allocates resources to each virtual server along with its own operating system, drivers, binaries,
            libraries, and applications. These virtual servers are isolated from each other and have no knowledge they
            are running within a virtualized platform nor aware that they are sharing resources with the other virtual
            machines.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
        <div class=wp-block-image>
            <img src="../images/comparison1.jpg" alt=""/>
        </div></div>
        <p>The software that is vital for virtualization is called a hypervisor. A hypervisor can be hardware, software,
            or firmware-based. Essentially, it is a virtual layer that separates the physical server from the virtual
            machines and allows for multiple guest operating systems to run side by side within that system. The
            hypervisor ensures that the VM&#8217;s have access to a defined amount of resources utilizing the main
            physical servers resources and that they remain separated and are portioned to each virtual machine as
            configured. VM&#8217;s can also update and modify the applications within their own space without affecting
            the applications on another virtual machine. </p>
        <p>VM&#8217;s can also provide an increased level of security as with isolation comes better control of the
            applications contained within each VM. If one VM becomes infected or corrupted, it will be kept separate
            from the other virtual machines as well as the host server. The VM is not aware of malicious activity on
            other portions of the physical server they reside on.</p>
        <p>Since each virtual machine is essentially a virtual copy of the hardware of the host server and uses its own
            operating system, it can be resource-heavy and slow, while consuming a great deal of memory and processing
            power. Each virtual machine can also be significant in size, which limits its portability and thus cannot
            easily be shared.</p>

        <h2>Containerization</h2>
        <h3>What Is A Container?</h3>
        <p>Containerization was developed to solve many of the problems of virtualization. The purpose of the containers
            is to encapsulate an application and its dependencies within its own environment. This allows them to run in
            isolation while they are using the same system resources and the same operating system. Since the resources
            are not wasted on running separate operating systems tasks, containerization allows for a much quicker,
            lightweight deployment of applications. Each container image could be only a few megabytes in size, making
            it easier to share, migrate, and move. </p>
        <img src="../images/comparison2.png"
             alt=vm-vs-containers
             sizes="(max-width: 1011px) 100vw, 1011px"/>
        <p>A container engine can easily manage large numbers of containers so we can create, add, and remove containers
            as needed. The maintenance of containers is also simplified since we need to update, patch, and fix bugs on
            only one operating system. It is also worth noting that containers decrease hardware costs since the
            allocation of multiple applications to the same hardware improves hardware utilization.</p>
        <p>However, containerization is not without its disadvantages. The most important one is security, as any
            vulnerability in the host kernel will affect all of the containers as well. Furthermore, in the case of
            malware, the container that is compromised can be terminated and replaced with a new clean image. Some of
            the vital features available in virtual machines are not available in containers either, which makes it all
            that more difficult to keep the system secure. Since only one operating system runs on the server, all
            applications will need to be based on the same operating system, which limits the adaptability and diversity
            of applications that can be used.</p>
        <h3>Virtualization vs Containerization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speed</strong>: When it comes to speed, containers were meant to significantly reduce the time
                needed to deploy and run an application. The container starts immediately, since the operating system is
                already up and running, so the application will start up without any noticeable delay. This is an
                excellent solution for a development environment, mainly, as it saves time in the application testing
                cycle. On the other hand, virtual machines need to start the entire operating system, which includes the
                full boot process. This will also include the startup of the services, and it will take much longer than
                it would for a container.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resources</strong>: Since virtual servers run separate operating systems, and every system call
                has to go through the virtualization layer, a certain amount of overhead is created, causing more
                resources to be used. This is particularly true for memory usage, as virtual machines consume memory
                even when they arenâ€™t running any user processes. However, CPU virtualization is relatively cheap, so
                the CPU overhead of a virtual machine can be much smaller. When it comes to containers, they can start
                up pretty quickly, so their memory consumption doesn&#8217;t increase. There is also much less overhead
                as they are using the same operating system without a hypervisor to go through.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security and isolation</strong>: In regard to security and isolation, virtualization wins, as it
                keeps virtual machines separate and isolated from each other. One infected virtual machine will not
                affect another one, and each virtual machine can incorporate its own security protocols since they are
                running in a fully isolated environment. However, since containers only isolate data and applications at
                the process level, they provide a less secure environment and depend on the security protocols of the
                host system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Portability and application sharing</strong>: Since container images are much smaller than
                virtual machines, they are easier to transfer and save space on the hostâ€™s filesystem. Virtual machines,
                on the other hand, need to have a copy of the whole operating system, including the kernel, system
                libraries, configuration files, all the directories required by the operating system and all the
                utilities. This dramatically increases the size of the image and is not that easy to share. Container
                images can be shared in any manner of ways, and there are a number of application sharing hubs on the
                internet. Virtual machine images do not have such centralized hubs and would usually need to be uploaded
                to another server instead.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operating system requirements</strong>: A virtual machine is best used in the case when a
                business needs to run multiple applications that require the full functionality of a dedicated operating
                system. However, if most of the applications have the same operating system requirements, the containers
                would be a much more practical solution.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application lifecycle</strong>: Containers are highly suitable for short-term application needs,
                as they can be set up quickly, are portable, and can be started up much faster. They are, however,
                limited by the lack of a dedicated operating system, processing, and storage resources. Containers
                should be used when the biggest priority is maximizing the number of applications running on a minimal
                amount of servers. However, virtual machines are far better suited for applications that need to be used
                for an extended period of time, since they run in a virtualized environment that is more robust and
                versatile.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hybrid Solutions?</h2>
        <p>However, it is also important to note that there are also ways of combining virtualization and
            containerization so that both technologiesâ€™ advantages are brought together. Such a combination is called a
            hybrid container architecture, and it can combine them by putting a virtual machine inside of a container,
            or a single container inside of a virtual machine, or multiple containers inside a virtual machine. This
            way, we can get the security and isolation of a virtual machine with the quick and lightweight setup of an
            application inside of a container.</p>

                <th><strong>Virtualization</strong></th>

            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>More secure and fully isolated</td>
                <td>Less secure and isolated at the process level</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Heavyweight, high resource <br>usage</td>
                <td>Lightweight, less resource usage</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hardware-level virtualization<br></td>
                <td>Operating system virtualization<br></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Each virtual machine runs in <br>its own operating system</td>
                <td>All containers share the host <br>operating system</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Startup time in minutes and slow provisioning</td>
                <td>Startup time in milliseconds and quicker provisioning</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>To summarize, we can see that each technology serves a different purpose and that choosing one depends
            heavily on the user and application needs and server capacity. Since both virtualization and
            containerization come with significant advantages and drawbacks, choosing one over the other needs to be
            done carefully with these points in mind. To decide more efficiently, we can see a quick overview of the
            comparison in the table below.</p>
